    - Create a new branch called “alternate”.
    - Still in main, create a “timeline.txt” file. Add the text “good timeline”.

    - Switch to the second branch.
    - Ensure the “only-in-main.txt” and “timeline.txt” files are not visible in this branch.
    - Create a “timeline.txt” file, and add the text “evil timeline” and save.
    - Switch back to main
    - merge
